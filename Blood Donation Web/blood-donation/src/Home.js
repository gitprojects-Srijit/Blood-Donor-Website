                        <h2><b>Importance of Blood Donation</b></h2>
                        <p>Blood donation helps people in need, and it helps people in your community. When you give, others live. Donors, especially those who donate regularly, keep our nation's blood supply stable. Although many people donate blood after disasters, blood is needed every day of the year. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions</p>

                        <h2><b>Why do we need blood?</b></h2>
                        <p>Blood brings oxygen and nutrients to all the parts of the body so they can keep working. Blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste materials to the lungs, kidneys, and digestive system to be removed from the body. Blood also fights infections, and carries hormones around the body. By taking preventive action, the need for blood transfusions will be significantly reduced, at the same time as fortifying health systems more generally.
